**Winter Wonderland** is a plugin that adds winter fun to your server! Wherever you walk, you leave a snow trail behind you, and snow particles are always at your feet! 

###So what exactly does this plugin do?

Winter Wonderland will do exactly **two** things to your server:

1. Spawn snow particles below a player's feet when walking
2. Wherever a player walks, they will leave a snow trail behind
  - The snow is temporary, and disappears after 2.5 seconds
  - The snow is special, and will not drop snowballs when it is broken

Suggestions are apprectiated, so feel free reply with any ideas you have for this plugin!

###I downloaded Winter Wonderland, but nothing changed on my server!

Winter Wonderland is a special plugin. Its features are only enabled certain days in the year. On December 18<sup>th</sup>, Winter Wonderland will automagically enable on your server! The features will disappear on January 1<sup>st</sup>, only to be seen again at the same time next year! Winter Wonderland can be configured to be always enabled.

###This plugin sounds cool! Where can I download it?
